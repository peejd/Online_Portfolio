# Philip Davidian Online Portfolio


## Description

This Portfolio webpage was created as an assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill.
It is a work in progress, but ultimately is intended to be used as a platform to showcase my Web Development work, as well as other works and involvements that I am proud of and want to share with acquaintances and potential employers. 

In building this page, I put into practice newly attained understanding of semantic HTML, Git version control and deployment, and several CSS styling proficiencies, including Flexbox, pseudo-classes, and media queries.

## Credits

This page was built using HTML and CSS techniques I have been learning through the UNC Coding Bootcamp.

The background image was taken by photographer Ralph Eames and is used here with his express permission.

The Tiny House image in the work section is the intellectual property of Nanostead LLC, a general contractor in Marshall NC for which I worked and built houses such as those pictured on the linked website. This image was also used with permission from that company's owner, Jeramy Stauffer.

All other images on the site were taken or created by myself.

In the course of building this webpage, I referenced the following helpful websites for coding syntax guidance:

https://www.w3schools.com/
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

And finally, a special thank you to Moses Nester and Daniel Ringernbach for their sage input in helping me find solutions for layout specifics for this webpage.
